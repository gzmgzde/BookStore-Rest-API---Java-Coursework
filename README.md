# BookStore-Rest-API---Java-Coursework
A RESTful Bookstore API built with Java JAX-RS, featuring in-memory data storage and full CRUD operations for Books, Authors, Customers, Carts, and Orders. This project was designed as coursework for a Client-Server Architectures module. It demonstrates core REST principles, layered design, and JSON data handling, and is tested using Postman.
